## 2. Program Overview

This **Six-Day Immersive Program on Generative AI & Autonomous Agents** is an advanced, hands-on curriculum designed for computer science students. The program goes beyond basic chatbots to provide a deep dive into the architectures that power sophisticated AI systems. Participants will learn to build everything from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to complex, multi-agent workflows using industry-leading frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, and the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK).

- **Title:** The Generative AI & Agentic Architectures Bootcamp
- **Objective:** To equip students with the advanced skills needed to design, build, and deploy complex AI agents and multi-agent systems for real-world applications.
- **Target Audience:** Computer Science and Engineering students with a foundational understanding of programming.
- **Duration:** 6 Days (5 hours per day, 30 hours total).
- **Prerequisites:** Solid understanding of Python and basic programming principles. Prior exposure to AI concepts is beneficial but not mandatory.
