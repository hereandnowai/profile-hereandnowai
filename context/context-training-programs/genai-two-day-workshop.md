## 2. Workshop Overview

We propose an intensive, hands-on **Two-Day Generative AI Workshop** designed specifically for engineering students. This workshop will equip participants with the foundational skills to build, customize, and deploy sophisticated AI-powered chatbots using the Google Gemini API.

Over the course of 12 hours, students will move from fundamental concepts to building four distinct, real-world AI projects, gaining practical experience in one of the most transformative technologies of our time.

- **Title:** GenAI for Future Innovators: A Two-Day Hands-On Workshop
- **Objective:** To provide students with the practical skills to build AI-powered chatbots and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems from scratch.
- **Target Audience:** Engineering and technology students.
- **Duration:** 2 Days (6 hours per day, 12 hours total).
- **Prerequisites:** Basic familiarity with programming concepts (Python) is helpful but not strictly required. A passion for learning and innovation is essential.

## 3. Key Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this workshop, students will be able to:

- **Understand Core GenAI Concepts:** Explain the fundamentals of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompting, and the role of APIs in AI development.
- **Build AI Chatbots:** Develop functional chatbots using Python and the Google Gemini API.
- **Implement Conversational Memory:** Engineer chatbots that can remember and reference previous parts of a conversation.
- **Master Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Build AI systems that can reason over and answer questions about custom data from text files and live websites.
- **Develop with Professional Tools:** Gain hands-on experience with Python, Gradio for UI development, and environment management for secure API key handling.
