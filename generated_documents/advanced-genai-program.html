<h2 id="program-overview">2. Program Overview</h2>
<p>This <strong>Six-Day Immersive Program on Generative AI &amp;
Autonomous Agents</strong> is an advanced, hands-on curriculum designed
for computer science students. The program goes beyond basic chatbots to
provide a deep dive into the architectures that power sophisticated AI
systems. Participants will learn to build everything from
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to complex, multi-agent
workflows using industry-leading frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph,
and the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title:</strong> The Generative AI &amp; Agentic
Architectures Bootcamp</li>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> To equip students with the advanced
skills needed to design, build, and deploy complex AI agents and
multi-agent systems for real-world applications.</li>
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Computer Science and Engineering
students with a foundational understanding of programming.</li>
<li><strong>Duration:</strong> 6 Days (5 hours per day, 30 hours
total).</li>
<li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Solid understanding of Python and
basic programming principles. Prior exposure to AI concepts is
beneficial but not mandatory.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="key-learning-outcomes">3. Key Learning Outcomes</h2>
